Art is communal, created by the artists for their audience. Science is a series of facts, tested and validated through peer review. Neither are meaningful in silos and both are enhanced and advanced with itterations from communial contributions.

The Art and Science of Technical Architecture is a place to share conventions, best practices, and showcase examples.
